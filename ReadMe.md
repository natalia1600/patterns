## Code style guide 
Every commit should be a good / working state unless otherwise specified. Use brackets to specify the commit topic, i.e. "[Wish Scraper] Code setup for shirts". We will try to commit small changes and frequently. When adding new files and folders, try to update the README as well. 

## Sewist Scraper Documentation

### How to run
Make sure to check that the file in `sewist_category_scraper.py` is correct to write in.

In your terminal, run `python3 sewist_category_scraper.py`


### Txt files
`sewist_categories.txt` includes the names of the categories in the format `"f{category_name}\n"`

`sewist_category_ids.txt` includes the names of the categories and IDs (the URL in the sewist editor) separated by a semicolon, in the format `"f{category_name}; {category_id}\n"`
